1. Study the folder structure of the project properly.

2. Study the contents and comments in backend/backend.dockerfile in detail.

3. NOTES ON backend.dockerfile:
  Notice that we copy the requirements.txt first and then the rest of the contents into /app
  - If we copy everything first and then install the dependencies such as:
    COPY . .   # Copies ALL files, including app code
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

  If we make a small code change in our FastAPI app, Docker rebuilds everything from scratch, including reinstalling dependencies.
  A better approach would be to:
  - Copy only requirements.txt first.
  - Install dependencies.
  - Then copy the rest of the files.

  To build the image, we use the command:
  - "docker build -t taskflow-backend -f backend.dockerfile ."
  - the -t flag	names (tags) the built image
  - the -f flag specifies a custom Dockerfile
  - It searches for the dockerfile within '.' path
